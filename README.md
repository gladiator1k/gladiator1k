milestones
----------

Since there is a lot to do, this project uses Github milestones. The project milestones are viewable [here](https://github.com/gladiator1k/gladiator1k/milestones).

Milestones are named after the gladiators from the 1992-2000 British TV series "Gladiators", chosen alphabetically. The first milestone is Ace, the next will be Blaze, and so on.
